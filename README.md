# FDA-Import-Refusals
Work in progress

In this repository, I will use the ETL process to transform the FDA Compliance Dashboard dataset "Import Refusals" for use in visualization.

The Import Refusals compliance dashboard can be found here: https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/imprefusals.htm

The full dataset as it is presented on that site, along with the reference guide for the column "Section Charges," are included in the Resources folder here.
